Here is my test protocol for the extension:

Secret question: not mandatory.

In options:
 - Change password (1st tab)
 - Set list type to blacklist (2nd tab)
 - Go to default blacklist (3rd tab)
 - Search for 'hsbc'
 - Remove 'hsbc.fr'

Activate extension (from extension toolbar button). Then:
 - Go to 'hsbc.com': page should be blacklisted
 - Go to 'hsbc.fr': page should as usual
 - Go to 'disney.co.uk': page should be as usual

Deactivate extension. Open options:
 - Go to custon blacklist
 - Add a new category. Use whatever name.
 - Add 'disney.co.uk'
 
Activate extension:
 - Go to disney.co.uk: should be blacklisted.
  
Deactivate extension. Open option:
 - Use whitelist
 - Go to default whitelist
 - Remove 'kidrex.org'
 - Go to custom whitelist
 - Add a new catgory. Use whatever name.
 - Add 'mozilla.org'

Activate extension
 - Go to 'kidrex.org'. Should be blacklisted.
 - Go to 'kideos.com'. Should be as usual.
 - Go to 'mozilla.org'. Should be as usual.
 - Go to 'google.com'. Should be blacklisted.

Deactivate the extension with a wrong password first.
Open options, go to reports tab (4th tab):
 - First tab: fail login attempt should be listed.
 - Go to visit report: all visited websites should be listed.
 - Go to time report: some time should be displayed for added whitelist category.

Go to time constraints tab (5th tab):
 - Set an hour constraint for the current time

Activate the extension. Got to any website: should be forbidden.

Keep in mind this protocol does not test every feature of the extension.
